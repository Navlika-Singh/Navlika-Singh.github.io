    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am an MSc student in Computing (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) at Imperial College London, where I aim to explore research directions at the intersection of Generative AI, Vision–Language Modeling, and Alignment for Responsible AI systems.
      
      Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at IIT Jodhpur, where I worked with Prof. Mayank Vatsa and Prof. Richa Singh on developing a novel bias mitigation framework to reduce neural networks' reliance on spurious correlations, in
      multiple-unknown-bias settings. I also collaborated with Prof. Anand Mishra on Vision–Language Modeling projects, with Prof. Pratik Mazumder on Bias Mitigation projects, and with Prof. Suchetana Chakraborty on IoT projects.

      Beyond IIT Jodhpur, I have pursued collaborations internationally. I worked as a Visiting Researcher at Dalhousie University via the prestigious MITACS Globalink Research Internship, Canada, with Prof. Christopher Whidden, where I evaluated transfer learning strategies for marine species detection and later published in the ICES Journal of Marine Science.
